Predictive Analysis of Electric Vehicle Charging Patterns using Machine Learning

üß© Problem Statement

With the increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations and energy providers face challenges in managing unpredictable charging demand. Sudden peaks in power usage can cause grid instability, longer charging times, and inefficient energy distribution.

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting EV charging behavior using machine learning techniques. By studying real-world EV charging session data, we aim to forecast future charging demand and identify the time periods of highest load.

The insights will help:

Optimize charging station operations

Prevent overloading during peak hours

Support smart grid management

Enable sustainable EV infrastructure planning

üìä Dataset Used

Dataset Name: Electric Vehicle Charging Dataset

Source: Kaggle ‚Äì Electric Vehicle Charging Dataset

Description: The dataset contains records of EV charging sessions with details such as connection time, charging duration, energy consumption, and day number. It is used to study how charging demand varies over time and to build a prediction model.

No. of Records: ~1,000+ entries

File Format: CSV

üîç Features / Attributes
Feature Name	Description
ConnectionTime	       The time when the vehicle started charging
ChargingDuration	     Total duration (in minutes/hours) of the charging session
EnergyConsumption	     Energy consumed during each charging session (in kWh)
DayNumber            	 Day of the week (1‚Äì7) for identifying daily usage patterns
StartTime	             Time of day the charging started
EndTime	               Time of day the charging ended
ChargingPower	         The power level (if available) used during the session

ü§ñ Approach / Methodology

Data Collection: Downloaded dataset from Kaggle.

Data Pre-processing: Handled missing values, converted date/time columns, and normalized numeric features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Found busiest hours and peak demand days

Visualized energy usage trends using graphs and histograms

Model Building: Used Linear Regression to predict energy consumption and future charging demand based on day and time.

Evaluation: Compared predicted vs. actual energy usage using MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

üìà Result / Expected Outcome

Identified peak charging hours (evening 6‚Äì9 PM) as high-load periods.

Predicted energy demand with good accuracy using regression models.

Insights can help optimize station energy allocation and reduce grid overloads.

Future work: integrate renewable energy data (solar/wind) to recommend eco-friendly charging schedules.
